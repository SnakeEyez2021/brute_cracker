# brute_cracker
This scrip was created by following the instructions on ITPROTV. It is very basic and was created as a final project for a Security Automation Class. 
For educational purposes I created a Metasploitable VM and used this script to crack the 4 character password.
Given the known login: "msfadmin", a 4 character password only took about 8 mins and 6 seconds to crack.
Thanks for taking to time to view my final project.
